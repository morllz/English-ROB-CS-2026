### computer sience - informatik
### O(n) ("Big o of n") Notation
### CAD (computer aided design)
### Bit / Byte
### boolean
### array
**Das Array: A data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. It allows for fast access using an index.**
### integer
**Die Ganzzahl: A primitive data type that represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) without any fractional or decimal parts.**
### Hashmap
**Die Hash-Tabelle: A data structure that maps "keys" to "values." It uses a hash function to compute an index, allowing for very fast data retrieval (e.g., looking up a phone number by a name).**
### logic gates
**Das Logikgatter: The basic building blocks of digital circuits (hardware). They perform logical operations (like AND, OR, NOT) on binary inputs (0s and 1s) to produce a single binary output.**
### list
**Die Liste: An abstract data type that represents an ordered sequence of values. Unlike an array, a list often has a dynamic size (it can grow or shrink easily).**
### artificial intelligence
**Die Künstliche Intelligenz: The branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, or translating languages.**
### Robot
*** A robot is a programmable machine that can sense its environment, process information, and perform physical actions autonomously or semi-autonomously to achieve specific tasks. ***
### Query
*** A query is a request for information or data from a system, database, or program. ***
### algorithm
*** An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that takes input, processes it according to defined rules, and produces output. ***
### (Binary-) Tree 
*** A binary tree is a tree data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and references to at most two child nodes, forming a parent–child hierarchy. ***
### Compiler
*** A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or another low-level language that a computer can execute. ***
### Interpreter
*** An interpreter is a program that executes source code directly by translating and running it line by line, without producing a separate machine code file. ***
### voltage
*** Voltage is the electrical potential difference between two points, which causes electric charge to flow in a circuit. ***
### optimization
*** Optimization involves selecting the most efficient parameters, resources, or actions to improve performance, cost, speed, or accuracy under defined constraints. ***
### remote control
*** A remote control is a system or device that allows a machine or robot to be operated from a distance using wireless or wired communication. ***
### flip-flop
*** A flip-flop is a basic digital electronic circuit that stores one bit of data and changes its state in response to a clock or control signal. ***
### bluetooth
*** Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication technology used to exchange data between devices over low power radio waves. ***
### wifi
*** Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to local networks and the internet using radio waves. ***
### sensor
### ADC (analog-to-digital converter)
<!-- style="background-color: light-blue; border-style: solid;"-->
> **Definition**
>
> (dt. Analog-zu-Digital Konvertierer) An Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a system that converts analog signals (like from a joystick) to a digital signal. It creates a discrete-time and discrete-amplitude digital signal from a continuous-time and continuous-amplitude analog signal.
### preferences
### shader 
<!-- style="background-color: light-blue; border-style: solid;"-->
> **Definition**
>
> (dt. Schattierer) Program that transforms data as it moves through the rendering pipeline. Graphical Processing Units (GPU) are designed to run shaders.
### debugging/ debugger
### laboratory
<!-- style="background-color: light-blue; border-style: solid;"-->
> **Definition**
>
> (dt. Laboratorium) Scientific facility that provides controlled conditions for research and experiments.
### Memory Elements
### Queue
<!-- style="background-color: light-blue; border-style: solid;"-->
> **Definition**
>
> (dt. Schlange) Uses the first-in first-out principle. Tasks are processed in the order they arrive at the processor.
### Stack
### (coding) environment
<!-- style="background-color: light-blue; border-style: solid;"-->
> **Definition**
>
> (dt. Programmierumgebung) Software to write programs (e.g. a text editor). An integrated development environment (IDE) also provides integrated tools, like debuggers, to improve productivity.
### engine 
### storage
### libraries  *** collection of pre written, reusable code e.g functions *** <br> 
### dictionary *** data structure that saves via key:value pairs *** <br>
### ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit  *** part of a processor that is taskt with arithmetic operations e.g addition *** <br>
### intelligence *** general term for the ability of an individual to adapt to its surroundings *** <br>
### pointer *** A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another value instead of the value itself *** <br> 
### conversion
### radio
*** Radio is sound communication by radio waves, usually through the transmission of music, news, and other types of programs from single broadcast stations to multitudes of individual listeners equipped with radio receivers ***
<br>
### preprocessor
*** ya macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation ***
<br>
### objects
*** an entity semantic that has state, behavior, and identity ***
<br>

### multimedia
*** the integration of various forms of media, such as text, graphics, audio, video, and animation, in a digital format ***
<br>

### searching algorithms
*** a method used to systematically explore alternatives in problem-solving, modeled as a search in a problem-space graph where nodes represent problem states and edges represent operators that change those states ***
### operating system
*** a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user ***
### internet                  (world wide web , das Internet)
