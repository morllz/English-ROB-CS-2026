### Robot
*** A robot is a programmable machine that can sense its environment, process information, and perform physical actions autonomously or semi-autonomously to achieve specific tasks. ***
### Query
*** A query is a request for information or data from a system, database, or program. ***
### algorithm
*** An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that takes input, processes it according to defined rules, and produces output. ***
### (Binary-) Tree 
*** A binary tree is a tree data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and references to at most two child nodes, forming a parent–child hierarchy. ***
### Compiler
*** A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or another low-level language that a computer can execute. ***
### Interpreter
*** An interpreter is a program that executes source code directly by translating and running it line by line, without producing a separate machine code file. ***
### voltage
*** Voltage is the electrical potential difference between two points, which causes electric charge to flow in a circuit. ***
### optimization
*** Optimization involves selecting the most efficient parameters, resources, or actions to improve performance, cost, speed, or accuracy under defined constraints. ***
### remote control
*** A remote control is a system or device that allows a machine or robot to be operated from a distance using wireless or wired communication. ***
### flip-flop
*** A flip-flop is a basic digital electronic circuit that stores one bit of data and changes its state in response to a clock or control signal. ***
### bluetooth
*** Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication technology used to exchange data between devices over low power radio waves. ***
### wifi
*** Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to local networks and the internet using radio waves. ***

### radio
*** Radio is sound communication by radio waves, usually through the transmission of music, news, and other types of programs from single broadcast stations to multitudes of individual listeners equipped with radio receivers ***
<br>
### preprocessor
*** ya macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation ***
<br>
### objects
*** an entity semantic that has state, behavior, and identity ***

### searching algorithms
*** a method used to systematically explore alternatives in problem-solving, modeled as a search in a problem-space graph where nodes represent problem states and edges represent operators that change those states ***
### operating system
*** a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user ***
